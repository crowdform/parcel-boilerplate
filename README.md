# Frontend Challenge

Build this page using React.

We're looking to test what you already know and how you think through problems.

It should be pixel perfect and coded with the fewest possible lines of clean code.

## Designs

Built to a 1440px screen width, 1180px container width. Which is the same as Bootstrap.

Designs are here:

Use the "Inspect" tool to get exact values for sizes, colours, paddings etc (you'll need to be invited to the prototype by email for this).

When you click "Read Bio" the text card slides up to reveal the bio.

## SCSS

Use nested SCSS classes (e.g. don't keep rewriting the same parent class, nest children within one main parent class for each component)

Set font-size: 10px on the html tag. Then use rem for all values (e.g. 1rem = 10px, 4.5rem = 45px).

We use a version of BEM (block element modifier) for our naming structure.

.component__element-subElement--modifier

For example:

.item__header-subtitle--black

Use variables for all colours and fonts.

## HTML

Use Bootstrap for containers, rows and columns.

## Setup

A minimal React.js boilerplate with [parcel as bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel). Parcel is an alternative web application bundler to Webpack.

## Installation

-   `git clone https://github.com/crowdform/parcel-boilerplate`
